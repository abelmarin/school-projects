    <h1>Treatment of Livestock</h1>
    <p>Farm animals are animals which are born and raised specifically for human consumption.
      In the United States these animals are usually manufactured in factory farms.
      These are highly efficient factories which produce a massive amount of meat each year.
      According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, almost
      thirty-three million heads of cattle, over nine billion chickens, and over one hundred
      twenty million pigs were slaughtered in the US in 2017 alone.</p>
    <p>Of course, in the interest of being as efficient as possible any animals who are deemed
      to be undesirable are gotten rid of. This is the case with male baby chicks who are ground
      up alive because they do not produce eggs and are too small to be sold for meat.</p>

    <h2>Baby chicks being ground up alive</h2>
    <p>It is important to note, however that this is normal here in the United States.
      Just as killing and eating dogs is normal during the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China. For more information
      on this read the content under the "Pets" section of this site.</p>
