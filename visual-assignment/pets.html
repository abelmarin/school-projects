    <h1>Treatment of Pets</h1>
    <p>Pets are animals which are kept as companions to humans. Here in the United States
      pets are treated like children and showered with toys and affection. I can personally
      attest to this as you can see by my spoiled pug Rosita. There is also a seemingly endless
      amount of cat and dog pictures on the internet; all showing their love for their pets.</p>

    <h2>My Pug Rosita<br>-Abel Marin</h2>
    <p>However, pets are not treated in such a kind manner all over the world. For example,
      in China there is the infamous Yulin Dog Meat Festival. During this festival, thousands
      of cats and dogs are killed and eaten annually. These dogs are often slaughtered and
      cooked in the streets of Yulin for all to see. It is important to note that this is considered
      completely normal to the people who take part in this event. It is apart of the culture in
      the local area. An awareness of one's own culture is always necessary when discussing a culture which is foreign to one's own.
