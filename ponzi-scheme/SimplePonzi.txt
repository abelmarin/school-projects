For Simple Ponzi I decided to only have one public function which a user can call.
This function is invest and a user must send .01 ether in order to be able to call this function.
When they have sent the ether the function then checks to see if they are already an investor.
If so then the function will not allow them to continue on with the transaction and an error will be generated.
This is done to simplify how payouts and investing works.
If the user is not already an investor then they are added to the array foolishInvestors.
Next the function payOut is called.
This function takes 10 percent of the amount inside the contract and splits it up evenly amoung all investors in the foolishInvestors array.

Example: 
Alice calls the invest() function and sends .01 ether. She immediatly gets 10% of this back
so the contract balance is .009 ether. Bob comes along later and also invests .01 ether.
Both Alice and Bob spilt 10% of the contracts balance. So now the contract balance is .0171 ether.
Next Caroline comes in and invests 1 ether. Alice, Bob, and Caroline each spilt 10% of the contracts balance.
Now the contract balance is now .91539 ether. Diane invests 3 ether. Contract balance is now 3.523851 ether.
